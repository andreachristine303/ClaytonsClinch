<h1>Clayton's Clinch</h1>
<h2>Rules:</h2>
<h3>What is a Clayton's Clinch you ask?</h3>

	<p>Some people refer it as survivor pool, elimination or knock out. Each week you pick one NFL team to win their game, if that team wins you move on to the next week and you can not pick that same team for the rest of the regular season. If the team you picked loses you are out completely. No Limit to the size of your league! 
	</p>

<h3>Points:</h3>

	<p>When you pick a team, you will get the points they win or lose by. If they win by 14, you get +14. If they lose by 10, you get -10. Points are kept throughout the season and you can only pick each team once. You will not get eliminated if you pick a losing team, just the negative points. No Limit to the size of your league!
